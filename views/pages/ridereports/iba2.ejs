			<h4 class="tuck-content">Tour of Honor Extreme (SS1000 & BB1500)</h4>
			<h5 class="tuck-content">August 13th, 2020</h5>
			<p>Over the weekend I got to finally complete a Tour of Honor ride. I had signed up in 2018, but never got the chance to participate that year.</p>
			
			<p>After looking at the California bonuses I figured I could do a SaddleSore 1000 Extreme and hit all 7 bonuses. I would head generally north and if I included my return home, could net a BunBurner Extreme as well.</p>
			
			<p>My planned route took me east out of Santa Barbara to Mojave where I’d turn north to head up US-395. Just before South Lake Tahoe I turn west again until San Francisco, where I turn northeasterly back over to Susanville. Then I’d beeline it back to Santa Barbara to close out the ride.</p>
			
			<h6>Santa Barbara to Mojave</h6>

			<p>6:50am, let’s get this show on the road. With a full tank of gas I’m outta here. South on 101 to eastbound 126 went super smooth with hardly any traffic. Next was supposed to be south on I-5 to 14 West, but the offramp to I-5 south was closed. A quick glance at the map made these seem like a straightforward detour, just stay on 126 and then take a side street to the 14. However the GPS had a totally different idea, and wanted me to head through the Newhall Ranch neighborhood and then onto San Francisquito Road. I decided to see what the GPS had in mind, and it turned out to be a fantastic road. A moderately twisty canyon road with hardly any traffic, score! This road took me through Green Valley and eventually through Lancaster where I joined the 14 and headed north into Mojave.</p>
			
			<h6>Mojave to Big Pine</h6>
			
			<p>Leaving Mojave I got a great close up view of the Mojave Airplane Graveyard. It would be so cool to go walk through that someday, though I’m prety sure it is restricted. After leaving Mojave I continue on to Indian Sptings to catch US-395. An hour or so of 395 brings me to Big Pine where I snagged my first Tour of Honor Memorial, which happened to be CA1.</p>
