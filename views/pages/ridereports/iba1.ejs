			<h5 class="tuck-content">July 3rd, 2020</h5>
			<p>In June I completed my first IBA ride, earning me IBA # 72302. I rode from Dallas, TX to Buellton, CA though officially my path was Wautauga, TX to Santa Barbara, CA due to a false start and needing to find an ending witness. I was able to nest a SaddleSore 1000 inside a Bun Burner 1500 Silver, completing 1,527 miles in 27 hours and 3 minutes.</p>
			
			<p>This was a supremely uneventful ride, so I didn't take any notes or pics outside the required documentation, so there isnâ€™t much to report on. Future rides will be better notated to take advantage of having my own platform to host ride reports though.</p>
